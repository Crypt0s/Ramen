Writing Plugins

== All Plugins ==
 * Are considered enabled if in the plugin folder(s)
 * You are expected to provide threadsafe code
 * Each scanprocess process could possibly execute your plugin simultaneously
 * Scanprocesses don't do anything with the returned values of plugins, they just pass off a copy of themselves to the thread
 * The longer the plugin task takes, the bigger the backlog will get and the slower the scanner will run
 * Make your plugin return as possible -- if you don't need to md5 hash an _entire_ file, then dont.

-- Extensions --
 * Selective
 * Based on some measurable file attribute (size,perms,extension,path,ect...)

-- Actions --
 * Performed on all files

A bad example is a plugin that writes to a single text file without any locks.
A good example is a plugin that writes to unique text files every time.

A bad example of a plugin is a plugin that reads every byte from a large file
A good example of a plugin is a plugin that uses a regex or reads portions of a large file

A good example of an action is a hashing function
A good example of an extension is downloading a certain file extension for later analysis
