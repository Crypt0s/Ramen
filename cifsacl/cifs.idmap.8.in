.SH "NAME"
cifs.idmap \- Userspace helper for mapping ids for Common Internet File System (CIFS)
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\ 'u
cifs\&.idmap [\-\-version|\-v] {keyid}
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the cifs-utils suite\&.
.PP
cifs\&.idmap is a userspace helper program for the linux CIFS client filesystem\&. There are a number of activities that the kernel cannot easily do itself\&. This program is a callout program that does these things for the kernel and then returns the result\&.
.PP
cifs\&.idmap is generally intended to be run when the kernel calls request\-key(8)
for a particular key type\&. While it can be run directly from the command\-line, it is not generally intended to be run that way\&.
.PP
cifs\&.idmap works in conjuction with winbind facility of Samba suite to map owner and group SIDs to uids and gids respectively\&.  It is best utilized when
.br
\t\- a mount option of cifsacl is specified when mounting a cifs share
.br
\t\- winbind is specified as one of the search entries for passwd and group databases in file /etc/nsswitch\&.conf
.br
\t\- file smb.conf has winbind specific entries
.br
\t\- winbind daemon program is running
.br
.sp
In case winbind and cifs.idmap facilities are unavailable, file objects in a mounted share are assigned uid and gid of the credentials of the process that mounted the share\&. So it is strongly recomemended to use mount options of uid and gid to specify a default uid and gid to map owner SIDs and group SIDs respectively in case services of winbind and cifs.idmap facility are unavailable\&.

.SH "CONFIGURATION FOR KEYCTL"
.PP
cifs\&.idmap is designed to be called from the kernel via the request\-key callout program\&. This requires that request\-key be told where and how to call this program\&. Currently cifs\&.idmap handles a key type of:
.PP
cifs\&.idmap
.RS 4
This keytype is for mapping a SID to either an uid or a gid
.RE
.PP
To make this program useful for CIFS, you will need to set up entry for it in request\-key\&.conf(5)\&. Here is an example of an entry for this key type:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
#OPERATION  TYPE           D C PROGRAM ARG1 ARG2\&.\&.\&.
#=========  =============  = = ================================
create      cifs\&.idmap     * * @sbindir@/cifs\&.idmap %k
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
See
\fBrequest-key.conf\fR(5)
for more info on each field\&.
.SH "NOTES"
.PP
Support for upcalls to cifs.idmap was initially introduced in the 3.0 kernel.
