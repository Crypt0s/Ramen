.SH "NAME"
mount.cifs \- mount using the Common Internet File System (CIFS)
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\ 'u
mount\&.cifs {service} {mount\-point} [\-o\ options]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the cifs-utils suite\&.
.PP
mount\&.cifs mounts a Linux CIFS filesystem\&. It is usually invoked indirectly by the
\fBmount\fR(8)
command when using the "\-t cifs" option\&. This command only works in Linux, and the kernel must support the cifs filesystem\&. The CIFS protocol is the successor to the SMB protocol and is supported by most Windows servers and many other commercial servers and Network Attached Storage appliances as well as by the popular Open Source server Samba\&.
.PP
The mount\&.cifs utility attaches the UNC name (exported network resource) specified as
\fIservice\fR
(using //server/share syntax, where "server" is the server name or IP address and "share" is the name of the share) to the local directory
\fImount\-point\fR\&.
.PP
Options to
\fImount\&.cifs\fR
are specified as a comma\-separated list of key=value pairs\&. It is possible to send options other than those listed here, assuming that the cifs filesystem kernel module (cifs\&.ko) supports them\&. Unrecognized cifs mount options passed to the cifs vfs kernel code will be logged to the kernel log\&.
.PP
\fImount\&.cifs\fR
causes the cifs vfs to launch a thread named cifsd\&. After mounting it keeps running until the mounted resource is unmounted (usually via the umount utility)\&.
.PP

\fImount\&.cifs \-V\fR
command displays the version of cifs mount helper\&.
.PP

\fImodinfo cifs\fR
command displays the version of cifs module\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
user=\fIarg\fR
.RS 4
specifies the username to connect as\&. If this is not given, then the environment variable
\fIUSER\fR
is used\&. This option can also take the form "user%password" or "workgroup/user" or "workgroup/user%password" to allow the password and workgroup to be specified as part of the username\&.

The cifs vfs accepts the parameter
\fIuser=\fR, or for users familiar with smbfs it accepts the longer form of the parameter
\fIusername=\fR\&. Similarly the longer smbfs style parameter names may be accepted as synonyms for the shorter cifs parameters
\fIpass=\fR,\fIdom=\fR
and
\fIcred=\fR\&.

password=\fIarg\fR
.RS 4
specifies the CIFS password\&. If this option is not given then the environment variable
\fIPASSWD\fR
is used\&. If the password is not specified directly or indirectly via an argument to mount,
\fImount\&.cifs\fR
will prompt for a password, unless the guest option is specified\&.
.sp
Note that a password which contains the delimiter character (i\&.e\&. a comma \',\') will fail to be parsed correctly on the command line\&. However, the same password defined in the PASSWD environment variable or via a credentials file (see below) or entered at the password prompt will be read correctly\&.
.RE
.PP
credentials=\fIfilename\fR
.RS 4
specifies a file that contains a username and/or password and optionally the name of the workgroup\&. The format of the file is:
.sp

.nf
		username=\fIvalue\fR
		password=\fIvalue\fR

This is preferred over having passwords in plaintext in a shared file, such as
/etc/fstab\&. Be sure to protect any credentials file properly\&.
.RE
.PP
uid=\fIarg\fR
.RS 4
sets the uid that will own all files or directories on the mounted filesystem when the server does not provide ownership information\&. It may be specified as either a username or a numeric uid\&. When not specified, the default is uid 0\&. The mount\&.cifs helper must be at version 1\&.10 or higher to support specifying the uid in non\-numeric form\&. See the section on FILE AND DIRECTORY OWNERSHIP AND PERMISSIONS below for more information\&.
.RE

gid=\fIarg\fR
.RS 4
sets the gid that will own all files or directories on the mounted filesystem when the server does not provide ownership information\&. It may be specified as either a groupname or a numeric gid\&. When not specified, the default is gid 0\&. The mount\&.cifs helper must be at version 1\&.10 or higher to support specifying the gid in non\-numeric form\&. See the section on FILE AND DIRECTORY OWNERSHIP AND PERMISSIONS below for more information\&.

.RE
.PP
port=\fIarg\fR
.RS 4
sets the port number on which the client will attempt to contact the CIFS server\&. If this value is specified, look for an existing connection with this port, and use that if one exists\&. If one doesn't exist, try to create a new connection on that port\&. If that connection fails, return an error\&. If this value isn't specified, look for an existing connection on port 445 or 139\&. If no such connection exists, try to connect on port 445 first and then port 139 if that fails\&. Return an error if both fail\&.
.RE
.PP
servernetbiosname=\fIarg\fR
.RS 4
Specify the server netbios name (RFC1001 name) to use when attempting to setup a session to the server\&. Although rarely needed for mounting to newer servers, this option is needed for mounting to some older servers (such as OS/2 or Windows 98 and Windows ME) since when connecting over port 139 they, unlike most newer servers, do not support a default server name\&. A server name can be up to 15 characters long and is usually uppercased\&.

setuids
.RS 4
If the CIFS Unix extensions are negotiated with the server the client will attempt to set the effective uid and gid of the local process on newly created files, directories, and devices (create, mkdir, mknod)\&. If the CIFS Unix Extensions are not negotiated, for newly created files and directories instead of using the default uid and gid specified on the the mount, cache the new file\'s uid and gid locally which means that the uid for the file can change when the inode is reloaded (or the user remounts the share)\&.
.RE
.PP
nosetuids
.RS 4
The client will not attempt to set the uid and gid on on newly created files, directories, and devices (create, mkdir, mknod) which will result in the server setting the uid and gid to the default (usually the server uid of the user who mounted the share)\&. Letting the server (rather than the client) set the uid and gid is the default\&.If the CIFS Unix Extensions are not negotiated then the uid and gid for new files will appear to be the uid (gid) of the mounter or the uid (gid) parameter specified on the mount\&.
.RE
.PP
perm
.RS 4
Client does permission checks (vfs_permission check of uid and gid of the file against the mode and desired operation), Note that this is in addition to the normal ACL check on the target machine done by the server software\&. Client permission checking is enabled by default\&.
.RE
.PP
noperm
.RS 4
Client does not do permission checks\&. This can expose files on this mount to access by other users on the local client system\&. It is typically only needed when the server supports the CIFS Unix Extensions but the UIDs/GIDs on the client and server system do not match closely enough to allow access by the user doing the mount\&. Note that this does not affect the normal ACL check on the target machine done by the server software (of the server ACL against the user name provided at mount time)\&.
.RE
.PP
dynperm
.RS 4
Instructs the server to maintain ownership and permissions in memory that can\'t be stored on the server\&. This information can disappear at any time (whenever the inode is flushed from the cache), so while this may help make some applications work, it\'s behavior is somewhat unreliable\&. See the section below on FILE AND DIRECTORY OWNERSHIP AND PERMISSIONS for more information\&.
.RE
.PP
directio
.RS 4
Do not do inode data caching on files opened on this mount\&. This precludes mmaping files on this mount\&. In some cases with fast networks and little or no caching benefits on the client (e\&.g\&. when the application is doing large sequential reads bigger than page size without rereading the same data) this can provide better performance than the default behavior which caches reads (readahead) and writes (writebehind) through the local Linux client pagecache if oplock (caching token) is granted and held\&. Note that direct allows write operations larger than page size to be sent to the server\&. On some kernels this requires the cifs\&.ko module to be built with the CIFS_EXPERIMENTAL configure option\&.
.RE
.PP
strictcache
.RS 4
Use for switching on strict cache mode\&. In this mode the client reads from the cache all the time it has Oplock Level II, otherwise - read from the server\&. As for write - the client stores a data in the cache in Exclusive Oplock case, otherwise - write directly to the server\&.

mapchars
.RS 4
Translate six of the seven reserved characters (not backslash, but including the colon, question mark, pipe, asterik, greater than and less than characters) to the remap range (above 0xF000), which also allows the CIFS client to recognize files created with such characters by Windows\'s POSIX emulation\&. This can also be useful when mounting to most versions of Samba (which also forbids creating and opening files whose names contain any of these seven characters)\&. This has no effect if the server does not support Unicode on the wire\&. Please note that the files created with mapchars mount option may not be accessible if the share is mounted without that option\&.

Use inode numbers (unique persistent file identifiers) returned by the server instead of automatically generating temporary inode numbers on the client\&. Although server inode numbers make it easier to spot hardlinked files (as they will have the same inode numbers) and inode numbers may be persistent (which is userful for some sofware), the server does not guarantee that the inode numbers are unique if multiple server side mounts are exported under a single share (since inode numbers on the servers might not be unique if multiple filesystems are mounted under the same shared higher level directory)\&. Note that not all servers support returning server inode numbers, although those that support the CIFS Unix Extensions, and Windows 2000 and later servers typically do support this (although not necessarily on every local server filesystem)\&.

.RS 4
Maximum amount of data that the kernel will request in a read request in bytes. Prior to kernel 3.2.0, the default was 16k, and the maximum size was limited by the CIFSMaxBufSize module parameter. As of kernel 3.2.0, the behavior varies according to whether POSIX extensions are enabled on the mount and the server supports large POSIX reads. If they are, then the default is 1M, and the maxmimum is 16M. If they are not supported by the server, then the default is 60k and the maximum is around 127k. The reason for the 60k is because it's the maximum size read that windows servers can fill. Note that this value is a maximum, and the client may settle on a smaller size to accomodate what the server supports. In kernels prior to 3.2.0, no negotiation is performed.

fsc
.RS 4
Enable local disk caching using FS-Cache for CIFS\&. This option could be useful to improve performance on a slow link, heavily loaded server and/or network where reading from the disk is faster than reading from the server (over the network)\&. This could also impact the scalability positively as the number of calls to the server are reduced\&. But, be warned that local caching is not suitable for all workloads, for e.g., read-once type workloads\&. So, you need to consider carefully the situation/workload before using this option\&. Currently, local disk caching is enabled for CIFS files opened as read-only\&.
.sp
NOTE: This feature is available only in the recent kernels that have been built with the kernel config option CONFIG_CIFS_FSCACHE. You also need to have cachefilesd daemon installed and running to make the cache operational\&.
.RE
.PP
multiuser
.RS 4
Map user accesses to individual credentials when accessing the server\&. By default, CIFS mounts only use a single set of user credentials (the mount credentials) when accessing a share\&. With this option, the client instead creates a new session with the server using the user's credentials whenever a new user accesses the mount. Further accesses by that user will also use those credentials\&. Because the kernel cannot prompt for passwords, multiuser mounts are limited to mounts using sec= options that don't require passwords.
.sp
With this change, it's feasible for the server to handle permissions enforcement, so this option also implies "noperm"\&. Furthermore, when unix extensions aren't in use and the administrator has not overriden ownership using the uid= or gid= options, ownership of files is presented as the current user accessing the share\&.

actimeo=\fIarg\fR
.RS 4
The time (in seconds) that the CIFS client caches attributes of a file or
directory before it requests attribute information from a server. During this
period the changes that occur on the server remain undetected until the client
checks the server again.
.sp
By default, the attribute cache timeout is set to 1 second. This means more
frequent on-the-wire calls to the server to check whether attributes have
changed which could impact performance. With this option users can make a
tradeoff between performance and cache metadata correctness, depending on
workload needs. Shorter timeouts mean better cache coherency, but frequent
increased number of calls to the server. Longer timeouts mean a reduced number
of calls to the server but looser cache coherency\&. The actimeo value is a
positive integer that can hold values between 0 and a maximum value of
2^30 * HZ (frequency of timer interrupt) setting\&.

.SH "SERVICE FORMATTING AND DELIMITERS"
.PP
It\'s generally preferred to use forward slashes (/) as a delimiter in service names\&. They are considered to be the "universal delimiter" since they are generally not allowed to be embedded within path components on Windows machines and the client can convert them to blackslashes (\e) unconditionally\&. Conversely, backslash characters are allowed by POSIX to be part of a path component, and can\'t be automatically converted in the same way\&.
.PP
mount\&.cifs will attempt to convert backslashes to forward slashes where it\'s able to do so, but it cannot do so in any path component following the sharename\&.
.SH "INODE NUMBERS"
.PP
When Unix Extensions are enabled, we use the actual inode number provided by the server in response to the POSIX calls as an inode number\&.
.PP
When Unix Extensions are disabled and "serverino" mount option is enabled there is no way to get the server inode number\&. The client typically maps the server\-assigned "UniqueID" onto an inode number\&.
.PP
Note that the UniqueID is a different value from the server inode number\&. The UniqueID value is unique over the scope of the entire server and is often greater than 2 power 32\&. This value often makes programs that are not compiled with LFS (Large File Support), to trigger a glibc EOVERFLOW error as this won\'t fit in the target structure field\&. It is strongly recommended to compile your programs with LFS support (i\&.e\&. with \-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64) to prevent this problem\&. You can also use "noserverino" mount option to generate inode numbers smaller than 2 power 32 on the client\&. But you may not be able to detect hardlinks properly\&.
.SH CIFS/NTFS ACL, SID/UID/GID MAPPING, SECURITY DESCRIPTORS
This option is used to work with file objects which posses Security Descriptors and CIFS/NTFS ACL instead of UID, GID, file permission bits, and POSIX ACL as user authentication model. This is the most common authentication model for CIFS servers and is the one used by Windows.

There may be an increased latency when handling metadata due to additional requests to get and set security descriptors.

The mapping between a CIFS/NTFS ACL and POSIX file permission bits is imperfect and some ACL information may be lost in the translation.

If either upcall to cifs.idmap is not setup correctly or winbind is not configured and running, ID mapping will fail. In that case uid and gid will default to either to those values of the share or to the values of uid and/or gid mount options if specified.

.SH "ACCESSING FILES WITH BACKUP INTENT"
.PP
For an user on the server, desired access to a file is determined by the permissions and rights associated with that file.  This is typically accomplished using owenrship and ACL.  For a user who does not have access rights to a file, it is still possible to access that file for a specific or a targeted purpose by granting special rights.  One of the specific purposes is to access a file with the intent to either backup or restore i.e. backup intent.  The right to access a file with the backup intent can typically be granted by making that user a part of the built-in group Backup Operators.  Thus, when this user attempts to open a file with the backup intent, open request is sent by setting the bit FILE_OPEN_FOR_BACKUP_INTENT as one of the CreateOptions.

As an example, on a Windows server, a user named testuser, cannot open this file with such a security descriptor.

But the user testuser, if it becomes part of the group Backup Operators, can open the file with the backup intent.

Any user on the client side who can authenticate as such a user on the server,
can access the files with the backup intent. But it is desirable and preferable for security reasons amongst many, to restrict this special right.

The mount option backupuid is used to restrict this special right to a user which is specified by either a name or an id. The mount option backupgid is used to restrict this special right to the users in a group which is specified by either a name or an id. These two mount options can be used together.
.SH "FILE AND DIRECTORY OWNERSHIP AND PERMISSIONS"
.PP
The core CIFS protocol does not provide unix ownership information or mode for files and directories\&. Because of this, files and directories will generally appear to be owned by whatever values the uid= or gid= options are set, and will have permissions set to the default file_mode and dir_mode for the mount\&. Attempting to change these values via chmod/chown will return success but have no effect\&.
.PP
When the client and server negotiate unix extensions, files and directories will be assigned the uid, gid, and mode provided by the server\&. Because CIFS mounts are generally single\-user, and the same credentials are used no matter what user accesses the mount, newly created files and directories will generally be given ownership corresponding to whatever credentials were used to mount the share\&.
.PP
If the uid\'s and gid\'s being used do not match on the client and server, the forceuid and forcegid options may be helpful\&. Note however, that there is no corresponding option to override the mode\&. Permissions assigned to a file when forceuid or forcegid are in effect may not reflect the the real permissions\&.
.PP
When unix extensions are not negotiated, it\'s also possible to emulate them locally on the server using the "dynperm" mount option\&. When this mount option is in effect, newly created files and directories will receive what appear to be proper permissions\&. These permissions are not stored on the server however and can disappear at any time in the future (subject to the whims of the kernel flushing out the inode cache)\&. In general, this mount option is discouraged\&.
.PP
It\'s also possible to override permission checking on the client altogether via the noperm option\&. Server\-side permission checks cannot be overriden\&. The permission checks done by the server will always correspond to the credentials used to mount the share, and not necessarily to the user who is accessing the share\&.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.PP
The variable
\fIUSER\fR
may contain the username of the person to be used to authenticate to the server\&. The variable can be used to set both username and password by using the format username%password\&.
.PP
The variable
\fIPASSWD\fR
may contain the password of the person using the client\&.
.PP
The variable
\fIPASSWD_FILE\fR
may contain the pathname of a file to read the password from\&. A single line of input is read and used as the password\&.
.SH "NOTES"

This command may be used only by root, unless installed setuid, in which case the noeexec and nosuid mount flags are enabled\&. When installed as a setuid program, the program follows the conventions set forth by the mount program for user mounts\&.

Some samba client tools like smbclient(8) honour client\-side configuration parameters present in smb\&.conf\&. Unlike those client tools,
\fImount\&.cifs\fR
ignores smb\&.conf completely\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.PP
The primary mechanism for making configuration changes and for reading debug information for the cifs vfs is via the Linux /proc filesystem\&. In the directory
/proc/fs/cifs
are various configuration files and pseudo files which can display debug information\&. There are additional startup options such as maximum buffer size and number of buffers which only may be set when the kernel cifs vfs (cifs\&.ko module) is loaded\&. These can be seen by running the modinfo utility against the file cifs\&.ko which will list the options that may be passed to cifs during module installation (device driver load)\&. For more information see the kernel file
fs/cifs/README\&.
.SH "BUGS"

Mounting using the CIFS URL specification is currently not supported\&.

Note that the typical response to a bug report is a suggestion to try the latest version first\&. So please try doing that first, and always include which versions you use of relevant software when reporting bugs (minimum: mount\&.cifs (try mount\&.cifs \-V), kernel (see /proc/version) and server type you are trying to contact\&.
