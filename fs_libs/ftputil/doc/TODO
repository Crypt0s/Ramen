Planned:

- Python 3 support (see
  ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc2640.txt for some notes on
  internationalization)

  - `FTPHost.listdir` should return a list of byte strings in Python 2
    and a list of unicode strings in Python 3.

  - Handle encoding/decoding when writing/reading remote files. If
    possible use the conventions for Python 2 and 3.

- Support `FTPFile.seek` and `FTPFile.tell` as far as it makes sense.

- Clean up the code by using decorators (?)


Ideas for future development:

- See ticket system

- Add `ftp_session` module containing session classes (e. g. for
  passive mode connections)

- WebDAV support?
