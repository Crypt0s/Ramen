This is the release version of cifs-utils, a package of utilities for
doing and managing mounts of the Linux CIFS filesystem. These programs
were originally part of Samba, but have now been split off into a
separate package.

REQUIREMENT:

Kernel must have ability to get ACLs from CIFS (extended attributes via cifs). 
Built into later kernels and enabled on quite a few.

If you pulled down the git tree directly, then you'll need to
generate the autoconf/automake files before you can build. cd to
the top of the build tree and run:

    $ autoreconf -i

If you downloaded a release tarball, then just unpack the sources
and run these commands:

    $ ./configure
    $ make

To install binaries and documentation, run this:

    # make install

To install python, run this:

    # python setup.py build
    # python setup.py install
