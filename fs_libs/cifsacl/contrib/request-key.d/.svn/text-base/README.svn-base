As of version 1.5.5, prior to opening /etc/request-key.conf, the
request-key utility will look first in /etc/request-key.d for a file of
the key type name plus ".conf". These files are example config files
that distro packagers can use to have request-key autoconfigured to
use the cifs utilities that are installed. Typically, distro packagers
will want to drop the resulting .conf files into /etc/request-key.d.
