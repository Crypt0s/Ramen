#!/usr

This folder contains the different file access methods with which Ramen can enumerate files.
There's an interface contained in fs.py that all file system access classes are expected to follow.

If you don't have the ability in a filesystem to perform one of the functions of the interface, you'll have to have the function return some dummy value (None).  Ramen should be able to handle that.

For things like HTTP file systems (For scraping purposes) you'd create a new filesystem with access methods to the API.

Be aware that Ramen may quickly overwhelm small webservices or rate-limited API's so take that into account when writing the code -- have sleep calls in the methods to prevent overly-many calls locking out your account.
